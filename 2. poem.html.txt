      <h2>You have no idea, baby...</h2>
      <p>
        how much happiness you bring—<br>
        in the tiniest moments,<br>
        in the quietest things.<br><br>
        A simple smile from you<br>
        feels like fireworks in my heart.<br>
        A random chat, a playful glance,<br>
        melts me right from the start.<br><br>
        The way you run—<br>
        just to get me what I need,<br>
        or remember the tiniest things I love...<br>
        That’s real love, indeed.<br><br>
        When I break,<br>
        you bend beside me—soft and sure,<br>
        holding my pain like it’s your own.<br><br>
        And in that quiet grace,<br>
        I see what love is truly made of.<br><br>
        You leave the world behind<br>
        just to sit with me in silence,<br>
        to hold me, to hear me,<br>
        to love me with that gentlest defiance.<br><br>
        You care for my things<br>
        more than I ever could—<br>
        as if every piece of me<br>
        is something holy, something good.<br><br>
        Every little gesture of yours,<br>
        every “I’m here” you silently show,<br>
        makes me fall,<br>
        harder and deeper, every day more.<br><br>
        And now...<br>
        the thought of a day without you?<br>
        Unthinkable.<br><br>
        Because, baby,<br>
        you are my forever,<br>
        in every minute, in every miracle. 💫
